    <h1>WELCOME TO PROACTIVE TEAM</h1>

    <h2>TEAM PROFILE</h2>
      <h3>Team Name</h3>
        <p>Proactive Team</p>
        <p>As its meaning, I target being proactive for my team. Our slogan can be that hold the initiative and play the battle. We are always active with not only teammates but also customers. For business, my team will actively discuss customers to deal and get the final decision for the successful transaction. On the other hand, while working in a group, each member should open themselves to connect with others. It might lead to work productively.</p>
        <p>When we work in a group, each member will understand their role and take responsibility for their parts. We should determine who we are, what we need from the team, and what we contribute to the team. Team members had better be active while working and ought to be independent. It might lead to more efficient productivity.<p>

      <h3>Team Profile</h3>
        <h4>About myself</h4>
          <p>According to my result from the test of 16Personalities, I myself belong to the Protagonist type. This is a person who can connect and is able to understand people’s thinking. The desire of a Protagonist is that brings positive energy and attitude to those around us. These characteristics are matched with the name of my team which is named Proactive. Therefore, when I meet my teammates, I hope I can approach their lifestyle as well as work style.</p>
          <p>If I am a leader, I will support and guide others to learn, grow and might be able to perform what they think they cannot do. I will find out people’s traits to first determine whether they are suitable for me. I am not afraid of introverts or extroverts. I confidently communicate with them to understand each other and encourage them to push their confidence.</p>
          <p>If I play another role as developer or designer, I will attempt to overcome all of the new challenges. I usually motivate myself to develop all of the skills which are not only academic but also soft-skills. When I work with my colleagues or customers, I would like to make win-win relationships. From my perspective, in a team, we should prompt our teammates to support and collaborate with each other.</p>
        <h4>How to operate successful teamwork</h4>
          <p>It should create an environment where they feel fair and comfortable to express their opinions and ideas.</p>
          <p>Don’t be embarrassed to express opinions and visions: Sometimes, a member will have a good idea, or stuck an aspect of thought out. If they share their views to others, accidentally someone will have the same thoughts and maybe help each other to deploy the project. Moreover, if they struggle with something in the project, they should present their problems to the team and together find a good way to solve it.</p>
          <p>Respect and listen to each other: When a team is formed, each teammate should learn how to listen and respect others. Despite being a fantastic project, it still has some mistakes. If people listen to each other, they can learn interesting points and be creative. It may lead the team to accomplish beneficial results. As a result, it is a motivation to help members develop their strengths and contribute more effectively to collective tasks.</p>
