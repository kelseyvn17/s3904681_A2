          <p>As its meaning, I target being proactive for my team. Our slogan can be that hold the initiative and play the battle. We are always active with not only teammates but also customers. For business, my team will actively discuss customers to deal and get the final decision for the successful transaction. On the other hand, while working in a group, each member should open themselves to connect with others. It might lead to work productively.</p>
          <p>When we work in a group, each member will understand their role and take responsibility for their parts.

            <h3>About myself from the test result</h3>
              <p>According to my result from the test of 16Personalities, I myself belong to the Protagonist type. This is a person who can connect and is able to understand people’s thinking. The desire of a Protagonist is that brings positive energy and attitude to those around us. These characteristics are matched with the name of my team which is named Proactive. Therefore, when I meet my teammates, I hope I can approach their lifestyle as well as work style.</p>
              <p>If I am a leader, I will support and guide others to learn, grow and might be able to perform what they think they cannot do. I will find out people’s traits to first determine whether they are suitable for me. I am not afraid of introverts or extroverts. I confidently communicate with them to understand each other and encourage them to push their confidence.</p>
              <p>If I play another role as developer or designer, I will attempt to overcome all of the new challenges. I usually motivate myself to develop all of the skills which are not only academic but also soft-skills. When I work with my colleagues or customers, I would like to make win-win relationships. From my perspective, in a team, we should prompt our teammates to support and collaborate with each other.</p>

            <h3>How to operate successful teamwork</h4>
              <p>It should create an environment where they feel fair and comfortable to express their opinions and ideas.</p>
              <p>Don’t be embarrassed to express opinions and visions: Sometimes, a member will have a good idea, or stuck an aspect of thought out. If they share their views to others, accidentally someone will have the same thoughts and maybe help each other to deploy the project. Moreover, if they struggle with something in the project, they should present their problems to the team and together find a good way to solve it.</p>
              <p>Respect and listen to each other: When a team is formed, each teammate should learn how to listen and respect others. Despite being a fantastic project, it still has some mistakes. If people listen to each other, they can learn interesting points and be creative. It may lead the team to accomplish beneficial results. As a result, it is a motivation to help members develop their strengths and contribute more effectively to collective tasks.</p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>If it is possible, I would like to call this idea “Health Care”. This program will help users monitor their health from reports via index on the sphygmomanometer or identifying the face expression. The sphygmomanometer is designed to look like a tablet device.</p>
        <p>Indexes will be updated day by day on the system. Users basically use a tablet and a computer having webcam, laptop or smartphone. When they access to our websites, through the camera and A.I technologies, the system will predict user’s status via their face expression and emotion. Next, we will use chatbot to communicate with user to get more accurate. After that, the system will suggest some advice before they can visit doctor. Also, they can bring the reports which they monitor at home to hospitals. It not only help user can know their health but also support doctors to find out the treatment way faster.</p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>The definition of  “health” is when the state of the human is the most comfortable and there would be no sickness or pain. Many experts recommend that if someone hopes to have a good health condition, they should periodically visit their doctor for checkups. Taking care of our health everyday might contribute to protecting yourself, your family or even the society against risk factors for disease.</p>
        <p>In the Covid-19 pandemic today, the medicine industry has terribly faced a range of challenges due to the epidemic. Hence, the health issue is a priority at the moment. Some countries still have a lockdown directive, citizens will be restricted going outside when the situation is not extremely necessary. During the lockdown period, people stay at home, why not take care of our health care and monitor our vitals right now? According to the statistics via Google Trends, since early 2021, the phrase “self-care” has been searched on the website that slightly increased.</p>

        <p>From separate countries, for instance, the Philippines stand on the top of countries where people concern about this topic.</p>
        <img src="./img/p5.png" alt="philippines">
        <p>In Australia, the data is updated from big cities which have a lot of traffic on sites.</p>
        <img src="./img/p4.png" alt="australia">
        <p>Most people do not care about their health because they think they have no symptoms at all. They will begin to concern their health when symptoms gradually appear. As a result, it may lead to bad consequences which are difficult to treat. According to NIH website of the US, I realise the importance of blood pressure. The author of this article said that high blood pressure is a “silent killer” which meaned very dangerous.</p>
        <p>In numerous diseases, whether it is hypotension or hypertension, doctors state that is the main reason relating to the death cases. In addition to periodically visiting the doctor, the family should equip a sphygmomanometer which measures blood pressure. It helps people control the unexpected up and down and might be able to avoid jeopardy. Since someone monitors their health frequently, they will not feel worried due to diseases. Moreover, they will get motivated to control their blood pressure with a balanced diet, physical and using medicine in the right way.</p>
