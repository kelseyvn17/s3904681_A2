        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>Receiving reviews from others will contribute to completing the project and to making a successful plan. From feedback, I might measure the quantity needed for my idea and look for solutions which solve the problems while implementing the project.</p>
        <p>In particular, there are some similar products in the market that I cannot avoid. Therefore, when I realize through the feedback, I will attempt to restrict some of the same characteristics and find out something new to develop ideas.</p>
        <p>We can predict that any plan is not perfect, it always has some mistakes. Getting experiences from reviews we received that will have both positive and negative effects. I will select which feedback is useful for not only developing projects but also enhance myself and my team in the future. I already received some questions that the readers cannot understand. That is one of the reasons which helps me persist in explaining in other ways and modify the words in reports. It might lead to my report as well as my website being clarified.</p>
        <p>It can be said that from the feedback, I realize a lot of problems in my projects. Something I guess is not important and does not need to be mentioned in the report. It has made customers as well as my reviewers not being clarified and even led them unsatisfied about my product. From my perspective, those feedback help me get more experience on how to make an IT plan, some mistakes I need to remember when I implement the IT project. Obviously, the feedback my friends sent me that supported me improving my project. Also, I recognize where the benefits and disadvantages are in my idea. I personally think feedback is not only evaluation but also advice. If I make something by myself, I will not look at the bad points in my own plans. Therefore, in the future, both working and studying I should ask from others because of the efficiency of products.</p>
