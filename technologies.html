        <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <h4>What does it do?</h4>
        <p>AI can be known as human brain. If people are able to do or understand something, AI application is installed in computer system and work as human. It is applied into amazing applications with different functions such as speech recognition or computer vision. These function support to recognize the face, word or objects.
    AI is one of a field in computer science. It is an intelligence which human program to support computer automate the human’s behaviors.</p>
        <p>In the society today, there are a lot of applications around us:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Face recognization through camera which is put in the airport and buildings.</li>
          <li>Virtual assistant (Siri, Google assistant, Alexa) can be able to hear, understand, answer and support the owner.</li>
          <li>Some applications in medical, using AI to diagnose diseases based on X-ray, or MRI.</li>
          <li>Smart TV also is combined with A.I tecchnology to improve image quality and recognize voice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the future, interaction with human is really appreciated. For instance, chatbot now is awkward about replying language. We will not know how about in the future.

It also can anticipate and make a decision without specific program. In other words, machine learning in A.I will support computer identifying basically like humans such as listen, see, and understand language, math, programming. Also, it might help human manipulate numerous information which is called Big Data.</p>
        <p>In the future, machine learning will tend to create compact devices.</p>
